Color transfer method
My attempt to implement color transfer method described in www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf
All the methods I have seen are incorrect and result image far from expecting.
There are images pic_1.jpg and pic_2.jpg, and result image should be pic_1_2.jpg. pic_1_2(1).jpg is what I've get with this code.
