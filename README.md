Color transfer method

My attempt to implement color transfer method described in www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf

Most methods I have seen give different results.
## Images
There are sorted images: images with one number index are sources, with two number indices - result images.

Letter indices: cv - made by this code, ps - photoshop, ml - matlab (https://github.com/hangong/reinhard_color_transfer), without - taken from article.

Result of 2nd image pack is ugly.
